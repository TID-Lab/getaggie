## Development

### Stylesheets
Changes should be made to the Sass files inside the scss folder. While adjusting styles, run:
`sass --watch scss:css`
This command will save the Sass files into CSS format.

### Test Site
The current live site can be found at https://tid-lab.github.io/getaggie/.

When developing on a local environment, open the index.html file in your preferred browser.
