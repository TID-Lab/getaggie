# Get Aggie Site

This is the Get Aggie page.

## Development

### Stylesheets

Changes should be made to the Sass files inside the scss folder. While adjusting styles, run `sass --watch scss:css`.
This command will save the Sass files into CSS format.

To see a `git diff` without the auto-generated CSS files, try `git diff HEAD -- . ':(exclude)css/*'`.

### Test Site
